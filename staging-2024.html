              <p class="subtext center">
              <ol>Now in its sixth year, the <b>State of AI Report 2024</b> is reviewed by leading AI practioners in industry and research. It considers the following key dimensions, including a new Safety section:
                  <li><strong>Research:</strong> Technology breakthroughs and their capabilities. </li>
                  <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Areas of commercial application for AI and its business impact. </li>
                  <li><strong>Politics:</strong> Regulation of AI, its economic implications and the evolving geopolitics of AI. </li>
                  <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Identifying and mitigating catastrophic risks that highly-capable future AI systems could pose to us. </li>
                  <li><strong>Predictions:</strong> What we believe will happen and a performance review to keep us honest. </li>
              </ol>


              <p class="subtext center">  
                <ol><strong>Key takeways from the 2024 Report include:</strong>:
                <li><strong>Frontier lab performance begins to converge and proprietary models lose their edge,</strong> as the gap between GPT-4 and the rest closes. OpenAI o1 put the lab back at the top of the charts - but for how long?</li>
                <li><strong>Planning and reasoning take priority in LLM research,</strong> as companies explore combining LLMs with reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms, and self-improvement to unlock future agentic applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Foundation models demonstrate their ability to break out of language,</strong> supporting multimodal research across mathematics, biology, genomics, the physical sciences, and neuroscience.</li>
                <li><strong>US sanctions have limited effects on Chinese labsâ€™ ability to produce capable models,</strong> as a combination of stockpiles, approved hardware, smuggling, and cloud access allow them to build highly performant (V)LLMs. Meanwhile, Chinaâ€™s efforts to build a domestic semiconductor industry remain scrambled.</li>
                <li><strong>The enterprise value of AI companies has hit $9T,</strong> as public companies experience a bull market for AI exposure. Investment in private AI companies also increased, but by an order of magnitude less, despite GenAI megarounds in the US.</li>
                <li><strong>A handful of AI companies begin to generate serious revenue,</strong>  including foundation model builders and start-ups working on video and audio generation. However, as models get cheaper as part of the corporate land-grab, questions around long-term sustainability go unanswered.</li>
                <li><strong>The pseudo-acquisition emerges as an off-ramp for AI companies,</strong> as some companies struggle to find a viable business model as staying at the frontier proves costly.</li>
                <li><strong>The existential risk discourse has cooled off,</strong> especially following the abortive coup at OpenAI. However, researchers have continued to deepen our knowledge of potential model vulnerabilities and misuse, proposing potential fixes and safeguards.</li>
                </ol>
