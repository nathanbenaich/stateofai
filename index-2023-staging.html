              <p class="subtext center">
              <ol>Now in its sixth year, the <b>State of AI Report 2023</b> is reviewed by leading AI practioners in industry and research. It considers the following key dimensions, including a new Safety section:
                  <li><strong>Research:</strong> Technology breakthroughs and their capabilities. </li>
                  <li><strong>Industry:</strong> Areas of commercial application for AI and its business impact. </li>
                  <li><strong>Politics:</strong> Regulation of AI, its economic implications and the evolving geopolitics of AI. </li>
                  <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Identifying and mitigating catastrophic risks that highly-capable future AI systems could pose to us. </li>
                  <li><strong>Predictions:</strong> What we believe will happen and a performance review to keep us honest. </li>
              </ol>


              <p class="subtext center">  
                <ol><strong>Key themes in the 2023 Report include:</strong>:
                <li><strong>GPT-4 is the master of all it surveys (for now),</strong> beating every other LLM on both classic benchmarks and exams designed to evaluate humans, validating the power of proprietary architectures and reinforcement learning from human feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Efforts are growing to try to clone or surpass proprietary performance,</strong> through smaller models, better datasets, and longer context. These could gain new urgency, amid concerns that human-generated data may only be able to sustain AI scaling trends for a few more years.</li>
                <li><strong>LLMs and diffusion models continue to drive real-world breakthroughs,</strong> especially in the life sciences, with meaningful steps forward in both molecular biology and drug discovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Compute is the new oil,</strong> with NVIDIA printing record earnings and startups wielding their GPUs as a competitive edge. As the US tightens its restrictions on trade restrictions on China and mobilizes its allies in the chip wars, NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD have started to sell export-control proof chips at scale.</li>
                <li><strong>GenAI saves the VC world, as amid a slump in tech valuations,</strong> AI startups focused on generative AI applications (including video, text, and coding), raised over $18 billion from VC and corporate investors.</li>
                <li><strong>The safety debate has exploded into the mainstream,</strong>  prompting action from governments and regulators around the world. However, this flurry of activity conceals profound divisions within the AI community and a lack of concrete progress towards global governance, as governments around the world pursue conflicting approaches.</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges mount in evaluating state of the art models,</strong>  as standard LLMs often struggle with robustness. Considering the stakes, as “vibes-based” approach isn’t good enough.</li>
                </ol>
